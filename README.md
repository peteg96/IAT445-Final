# Project Bokkusu
For a team project in IAT 445 Immersive Environments, I collaborated with Pete Gong and Qatar Wen to create a 3D narrative game using Unity and C#. Our focus was to deliver an immersive experience with a Japanese-style theme infused with mystery. As the primary programmer, I developed the core storyline and led terrain creation, blending creativity with technology to produce a captivating and engaging gameplay experience.
